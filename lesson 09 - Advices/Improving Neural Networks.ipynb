    "Bias is how much the predicted values differ from the actual values. Bias is the inability of a machine learning model to capture the true relationship between the data variables. **It is caused by the erroneous assumptions that are inherent to the learning algorithm**. For example, in linear regression, the relationship between the X and the Y variable is assumed to be linear, when in reality the relationship may not be perfectly linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "variance refers to how much a model's predictions vary or swing around the true values. If a model has high variance, it means it's sensitive to small changes in the training data, which can cause it to make very different predictions when given slightly different input. For example, if two different engineers overfit a data that are very slightly different. They are going to get completely different results. While if the model generalized to the data, the differences will be very minimal. Overfitting (high variance)  occurs when a model learns to memorize the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns.\n",
